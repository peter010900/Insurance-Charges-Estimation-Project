# Insurance-Charges-Estimation-Project

In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate insurance charges using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. I applied Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression models, optimizing the latter two through cross-validation. The project involved data preprocessing, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Ridge Regression effectively reduced overfitting, outperforming Lasso in this case
